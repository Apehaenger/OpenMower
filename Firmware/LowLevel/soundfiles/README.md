## Folder/Track Structure Description

- The original sounds are now in 'advert' as they're spoken, (background sound) interrupting,
  messages.
- Folder 'mp3' contains background sounds/noises.
- Due to the case that some DFPlayer don't play 'adverts' without a current running background
  sound, as well as someone might prefer no background sounds at all, the 'advert' sounds got
  also copied to a `playFolderTrack16()`.
  At the moment only folder '01' (USA), but a folder like '49' (German) might follow some days.
- The single sound in the root folder, is used/required for those
  DFPlayer types (i.e. DFRobot), which start autoplaying directly after power on, or by reset() during initialize.
